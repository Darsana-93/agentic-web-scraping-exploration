# Agentic Web Scraping Exploration

## Overview
This project explores web scraping using Python tools such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy, and studies how CAPTCHA acts as a constraint in automated systems.

## Scope
This project is for educational and exploratory purposes only. Scraping is demonstrated on publicly available test websites. CAPTCHA handling is explored conceptually and through decision logic, not through bypassing security on real-world production websites.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- requests
- BeautifulSoup

## Status
Phase 1: Basic web scraping (in progress)
